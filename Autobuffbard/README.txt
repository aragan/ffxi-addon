Listen carefully, it is unnatural, it is supernatural, it is advanced and superior to everyone, and they are primitive without it, it has been hidden for a period of time, it is difficult to reach it, it is smooth like water, it is solid like a mountain, it is light like the wind, it is burning like fire.. it was made for a long period of time, it came out of the power of darkness, only the light.. you cannot be defeated, and it is in your hands, the power is with you.
