This script is an addon to be used with Windower for Final Fantasy XI 
that allows you to set various types of music in the game.

***********************************************************************
I stopped playing FFXI (in February 2015) so I may not be able to help
with bugs but I'll try... So long as you can give me more information
then "it doesn't work"
***********************************************************************

The available commands are:
    setbgm list [music]
        Lists all of the available music in the game.
    setbgm list type
        Lists the different types of music you can set.
    setbgm <music id>
        Sets the background music given by the ID.
    setbgm <music id> <type id>
        Sets only a given type of music.
