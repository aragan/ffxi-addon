# AutoUNM
Newest version of the unm addon, rewritten to hopefully be much more reliable than old versions.  

--Commands

//unm start obj1 - this is all you should usually need

//unm start obj2 - if doing the 2nd unm in a zone with more than one

//unm stop - self explanatory

//unm stuck - release yourself if you manage to get packet locked
