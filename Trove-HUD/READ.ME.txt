Extract this folder to you Addons folder in Windower. When in game type //lua l Trove-HUD
After loading this addon, a random chest is chosen

After opening, use the command:
//trove next
to choose your next chest.

then use:
//trove reset
to start over again

I recommend these macros:
/con trove reset
/con trove next
