Add on used in order to monitor something like a Notorious Monster or Single-named pop. While it's alive it will be Green with a clock next to it (effectively 'now'). When it dies or is no longer up it will turn White and that clock will be frozen, thus you know the last time it was alive When it pops you can //mobmon runto to run in the direction/towards its x/y coords. Two notes:

You still have to target/claim yourself
This works based off Mob Array - so you're going to have to be withina bout 50 yalms of it popping
Usage:

//mobmon "Name of Mob"
//mobmon runto (runs in direction of mob)
Example: //mobmon Sisyphus
