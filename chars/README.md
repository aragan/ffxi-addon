# Chars #
This addon lets you input special chars using simple tags (e.g.: ```<note>``` for â™ª). Using the pattern ```<j:text>``` any alphanumeric character will be replaced with their full-width version ("japanese style" characters). The available characters depend on the [data](https://github.com/Windower/Lua/blob/master/addons/libs/chat/chars.lua) gathered by the Windower team. If anything in there is incorrect or missing, open an issue on [Windower's Lua issue tracker](https://github.com/Windower/Lua/issues).
