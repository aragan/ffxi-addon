AutoWS doesn't have a lot of commands for setting the config yet, sorry

    //asc autows on/off -- turns autows on or off

    //asc autows reload -- reloads your autows config

AutoWS settings.  Most settings are currently only available in autows-default.xml.
Create an autows-job.xml for job specific config, i.e. autows-PUP.xml
Make a subdirectory with your character name for character specific configs, i.e. data\Snicky\autows-PUP.xml
