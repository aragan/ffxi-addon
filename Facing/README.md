# Facing
An FFXI Windower Addon for determining what direction the player is facing in relation to their target.

## Features
* The direction you must turn to face your target.
* How many degrees you must turn.
* If you have enough TP to use a weapon skill.
* Customizable settings for position, size and color.

## Story
Has this ever happened to you?

![You're Surrounded!](http://ffxi.zeroserenity.com/Facing/Surrounded.png)

And you don't know which way to look to face your target?

Having problems where if you use the lock-on method to line yourself up the entire crowd moves and messes up what you were doing? Well I present the solution called Facing.

![Well this is handy.](http://ffxi.zeroserenity.com/Facing/SurroundedWithFacing.png)

With it, you get an indicator telling you which way to your target from your character's perspective.

Drop into first person (or use the compact keybindings Q and E) to rotate your character in place and stare your enemies in the face.

The indicator will show straight brackets when you are likely within swinging or weapon skilling angle (but not your distance). It will also turn colors to indicate if you have over 1000 TP to spend.

With it you can easily face your opponents and shut them down.

This can be most useful in cleaving situations, or weapon trials with [premevial brew](https://www.bg-wiki.com/ffxi/Primeval_Brew).
