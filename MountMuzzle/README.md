### Known Issues

- **Issue:** If Mount Muzzle is selected to automatically load and the player is mounted upon login, there is a significant delay before the chosen music will begin to play.
- **Issue:** Upon changing zones the default music can be heard for a moment before the chosen music begins to play.
- **Issue:** Unable to correctly set mount music to original if Mount Muzzle is unloaded while mounted.
- **Issue:** Unable to alter mount music upon addon unload through the Windower `exit` command, which causes client to crash. No known viable alternatives.
___    
### TODOs

- **TODO:** Investigate alternative methods for music change as packet injection/swap allows the player to hear the default music upon zone change and login, regardless of chosen music.
- **TODO:** Investigate methods for determining which mount type the player is on when loading/unloading Mount Muzzle.
- **TODO:** Investigate ways to prevent packet injection client crash/lock within unload event if triggered through Windower `exit` command.
