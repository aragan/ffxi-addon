![Sortie Addon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34732910/215006840-58f664e5-f21e-4b06-8797-56fe369b9ca0.PNG)


# Sortie
Addon to help keep track of objectives

Example of the use can be found on my Youtube channel
https://youtu.be/RjJdaFvuD8Q?t=3084

How it works:

A display should pop up upon entering sortie if loaded prior to entering.

Select your zone by clicking on the [x] zone or typing //st x

Tracking enemies is done via a widescan packet request.

As such - you have to be on the correct floor to track a mob.

A/B/C/D can be tracked anywhere "upstairs" but each basement must be entered before it can be tracked.

Bitzers are not mobs and thus can only be tracked with in 50 yalms.

Extra commands

//st save - saves profile information  
//st debug  
//st on/off  
//st x - this is the floor you want to see the objectives of  
//st track x - tracks the mob by sending a widescan request (Mob index)  
//st scan x - tests to see if the mob is found (Mob index)  

**Note - If clicking does not work you are likely in windowed mode**

The window taskbar is 50px and the Title bar is 25px so your resolution will not be 1080 but 75px less.

To correct the issue use the below setting for proper game resolutions
